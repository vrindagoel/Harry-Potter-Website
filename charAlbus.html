			<p style="margin-left: 50px; margin-right:50px; color:grey">"Albus Dumbledore was never proud or vain; he could find something to value in anyone, however apparently insignificant or wretched, and I believe that his early losses endowed him with great humanity and sympathy. I shall miss his friendship more than I can say, but my loss is as nothing compared to the wizarding world's. That he was the most inspiring and the best loved of all Hogwarts headmasters cannot be in question."<br>—Dumbledore's obituary</p>
			Professor Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore, O.M. (First Class), Grand Sorc., D. Wiz., X.J. (sorc.), S. of Mag.Q.[12] (c. Summer[1] 1881[2] – 30 June, 1997[2]) was the Transfiguration Professor, and later Headmaster of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Professor Dumbledore also served as Supreme Mugwump of the International Confederation of Wizards (?–1995) and Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot (?-1995; 1996-1997). He was a half-blood, Muggle-supporting wizard, the son of Percival and Kendra Dumbledore, and the elder brother of Aberforth and Ariana. His father died in Azkaban when Dumbledore was young, while his mother and sister were later accidentally killed. His early losses greatly affected him early on, even at his death, but in turn made him a better person. Albus Dumbledore was considered to be the most powerful wizard of his time. He was most famous for his defeat of Gellert Grindelwald, the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon's blood, and his work on alchemy with Nicolas Flamel.<br><br>
			It was through Dumbledore that resistance to the rise of Lord Voldemort was formed, as it was he who founded and led both the first and second Order of the Phoenix. Due to the fact that he had a keen mind and legendary power, Dumbledore became the only wizard that Voldemort ever feared. He was the wielder and the master of the Elder Wand from 1945 until 1997 and considered by many as the greatest Headmaster to ever grace Hogwarts. As he was about to die by a cursed ring, he planned his own death with Severus Snape. He was killed by Snape during the Battle of the Astronomy Tower.<br><br>
			Though he was no longer alive at the time, it was through Dumbledore's manipulations that Voldemort was ultimately defeated and peace restored to the wizarding world. He is the only Headmaster that was laid to rest at Hogwarts. Albus Dumbledore's portrait still remains at Hogwarts. Harry Potter later named his second son Albus Severus Potter after him.<br><br>

<br><br>
<p style="margin-left: 50px; margin-right:50px; color:grey">"Harry.... is becoming exceptionally good at Defence Against the Dark Arts. So that's the one area in which, almost instinctively, he is particularly talented. Apart from Quidditch."<br>&mdash; J. K. Rowling regarding Harry's magical talents</p>
Harry was seen and had proven himself to be an very talented and powerful wizard. His power was evident from the start: he demonstrated immediate command of a broomstick, was able to conjure a corporeal Patronus at an exceptionally young age (a mark of superior magical ability[92]), and even survived numerous encounters with Lord Voldemort. He mastered a wand made of hawthorn, which one should only ever consider placing in the hands of a witch or wizard of proven talent.[107] Harry was also a very gifted flyer and Quidditch player, the youngest Seeker in a century.<br><br><br>
<ol>
<li><b>Magical mastery:</b>Albus Dumbledore was considered to be one of the most powerful wizardof his time, and he lived up to this title on many occasions. After his first year at Hogwarts he was already known to be prodigiously talented in the magical arts, and considered nothing more or less than the most gifted student the school would ever see. He returned to the school later to serve as the Professor of Transfiguration, a complex and difficult field of magic. He was capable of defeating the Dark Wizard Grindelwald, despite Grindelwald being one of the most powerful Dark Wizards of all time. He was also the only wizard to ever be feared by the most dangerous Dark Wizards of all time, Lord Voldemort. This act was aided by Dumbledore's wielding of the Elder Wand, unknown to Voldemort at the time, although Voldemort noted that Dumbledore was not fighting to kill during the duel.[20]. Dumbeldor's powers seems to be comperable to those of Voldemort, but Voldemort seems to have much greater knowledge about the spells and their potential. also conversationally blatant about his confidence to escape from Azkaban when his arrest was attempted.<br><br><br>
<li><b>Intellectual genius: </b>Dumbledore was not only a great wizard, but also possessed an incredible intellect, capable of devising an elaborate master plan to defeat the seemingly unbeatable Lord Voldemort and was also particularly brilliant at guessing, hypothesising, and predicting. This was seen quite predominantly during the events surrounding the Second Wizarding War, when Dumbledore, through various strategical plans and an almost Machiavellian manipulation of key persons (such as Severus Snape and Harry Potter) before his death, is able to set the path for Harry Potter to locate Lord Voldemort's Horcruxes. His intellect, or at least his strategic thinking, is one of his key talents. His genius was mainly noticeable even after his death through his will. He bequeathed Ron Weasley his Deluminator, understanding that even though Ron would initially walk out on the Horcrux hunt, he would be just as likely to return to it. He knew that Hermione Granger's thirst for knowledge would lead her to investigate the symbol that he had drawn in the copy of The Tales of Beedle the Bard that he left her. This ultimately brought Harry to not only learning of the Deathly Hallows, but of how to obtain the Resurrection Stone through the Golden Snitch Dumbledore had left him, giving Harry the emotional support he needed to sacrifice himself to the Dark Lord. This indicates an incredible degree of foresight.<br><br><br>
<li><b>Duelling: </b>Dumbledore was a duellist of tremendous, almost unrivalled skill: easily capable of capturing several Death Eaters at once effortlessly and out-dueling Lord Voldemort during the Battle of the Department of Mysteries, though Voldemort managed to flee the duel. That being said, Voldemort possibly fled from the duel because he realised, for the very first time, that Dumbledore was far too powerful or skilled to defeat in a man-to-man duel, and did not want to be seen as the defeated party. He also easily defeated Cornelius Fudge, Dolores Umbridge, Kingsley Shacklebolt, and John Dawlish when they attempted to arrest him (though Kingsley was secretly on Dumbledore's side).However, it should be noted that he was wielding the Elder Wand on these occasions and that he did not want to kill any of his opponents. Arguably, the most impressive display of his duelling skills was shown when he defeated Gellert Grindelwald, despite the fact that Grindelwald was the master of the Elder Wand. Eyewitnesses claimed it was the greatest wizard duel ever fought. Albus described himself as being equal in power to Grindelwald, though he added that he may have been slightly more skilful. Dumbledore's duelling style often involved employing the element of fire, though he used water during his duel with Voldemort.<br><br><br>
<li><b>Invisibility: </b>Albus had the ability to render himself invisible without the use of an Invisibility cloak. To achieve such a state, Dumbledore merely used an extremely powerful Disillusionment Charm.[29] He was also capable of using the Human-presence-revealing spell, wandlessly and non-verbally[30] to detect the presence of people who were invisible, even if they were under an Invisibility Cloak. .<br><br><br>
<li><b>Occlumency and Legilimency: </b>Dumbledore was also accomplished in both Occlumency and Legilimency. Many people, particularly Harry Potter, often noted that Dumbledore sometimes seemed to see right into their mind and correctly decipher what they were thinking.[20] However, some of Lord Voldemort's followers, such as Barty Crouch Jr, proved to be excellent Occlumens capable of effectively hiding their thoughts from him. His skills in Occulumency were high enough that he was one of the extremely few capable of hiding his thoughts from Lord Voldemort himself, who was considered to be the greatest Legilimens in history. He also used a "great deal of skilled Legilimency" to extract memories from Morfin Gaunt in order to prove that Voldemort had killed the Riddle family.<br><br><br>
<li><b>Master of the Deathly Hallows: </b>Albus Dumbledore should be noted as the only person besides Harry Potter to possess all three Deathly Hallows, although like Harry Potter he did not possess all three Deathly Hallows at the same time. He first obtained the Elder Wand after he defeated the infamous Grindelwald. He had possession of the Cloak of Invisibility after he borrowed the it from James Potter, and after the deaths of James and Lily Potter he kept it safe until he returned the Cloak to Harry Potter on Christmas in his first year at Hogwarts. Finally he obtained the Resurrection Stone after locating and destroying the fragment of Voldemort's soul contained within the ring when it served as a Horcrux.<br><br><br>
<li><b>Wandless and non-verbal magic: </b>Albus could cast magic without the use of a wand, and was highly skilled at non-verbal magic. While some people, such as Antonin Dolohov, as seen during the Battle of the Department of Mysteries,[20] seemed to produce lesser magic when using it non-verbally, Dumbledore was capable of extraordinary feats such as conjuring hundreds of squishy purple sleeping bags to accommodate the students of Hogwarts, without saying a word.[23] While in The Cave, Dumbledore proved capable of foiling the defences set up by Lord Voldemort, using wandless magic. He also performed the Arresto Momentum spell, without a wand, to save Harry from falling to his death at the hands of the Dementors. He could also light and put out candles, both with the wave of his hand.<br><br><br>
<li><b>Magical Detection: </b>Dumbledore was able to recognise and identify the traces left behind by magic, seen as how he was able to detect the distinct magical energies of his surroundings to determine the nature of the defensive measures with which Lord Voldemort safeguarded his locket Horcrux, including successfully deducing that blood was needed for them to progress into the main chamber of the cave and uncovering the hidden boat chain.<br><br><br>
<li><b>Spell Creation: </b>Dumbledore was known for having created unique magical spells and devices. His deluminator was considered to be unique, and was of his own invention. Furthermore, after it had been bequeathed to Ron Weasley, he discovered that he could sometimes hear Harry and Hermione's voices through it, and that it also allowed him to Apparate to their location. He also developed a method to communicate using Patronus Charms, which he taught to the members of the Order of the Phoenix.<br><br><br>
<li><b>Fire Magic Affinity: </b>Albus' weapon of choice appeared to be fire, and he was incredibly talented at utilising it. In his duel against Voldemort he used a fiery rope; when he displayed his wizarding powers to young Tom Riddle, he did so by setting Riddle's wardrobe on fire, without actually burning anything; he once used a vast amount of fire to hold off a throng of Inferi. He is known to be able to conjure Gubraithian Fire. His magical pet, Fawkes, is a phoenix, which dies and is reborn from the ashes. Although Dumbledore favoured fire, during the Battle of the Department of Mysteries he used water to encase Voldemort; that was possibly because he did not want to harm Voldemort, but only protect Harry.<br><br><br>
<li><b>Magical multilingualist: </b>Dumbledore could also speak Mermish[32] and Gobbledegook. He can recognise Parseltongue, the language of snakes, as he demonstrated while he and Harry were inside Bob Ogden's stored memory; he was able to quote verbatim a Parseltongue phrase uttered by Morfin Gaunt in a later stored memory.<br><br><br>
<li><b>Ptioneer: </b>Dumbledore was also proficient at Potions, as, according to the obituary written by Elphias Doge, his papers were published in The Practical Potioneer. This was likely instrumental in his discovery of the Twelve Uses Of Dragon's Blood.<br><br><br>
<li>Charms<b>: </b>Albus was known to be a master in Charms, as his papers were published in Achievements in Charming. He could cast a corporeal Patronus charm (in the form of a phoenix) and created new parameters for said charm, allowing it to be used as a form of communication (with the caster speaking with their own voice through the Patronus). He was also capable of performing the extremely complex Fidelius Charm.<br><br><br>
<li><b>Transfiguration: </b>Before becoming headmaster, Albus was the Hogwarts Transfiguration teacher, showing that he had a high level of skill in that area. During his battle with Voldemort in the Battle of the Department of Mysteries, Dumbledore was even able to cast a glass to sand shield that immediately transfigured the thousands of glass shards that were directed at him and Harry by Voldemort into mere sand en route. He was also able to transfigure the Slytherin banners in the Great Hall to that of Gryffindor's simply by clapping his hands.<br><br><br>
<li><b>Defense Against The DArk Arts: </b>Dumbledore was also extremely proficient in Defence against the Dark Arts, as evidenced by the fact that he is the only wizard with sufficient DADA abilities to not only duel against Lord Voldemort and Gellert Grindelwald, who were the most powerful Dark Wizards in history on equal grounds, but also even outclass them. His DADA abilities allowed him to briefly suppress the curse he was inflicted with by touching the horcrux ring, which was performed by Lord Voldemort himself and had "extraordinary power", long enough for him to destroy the ring and return to Hogwarts to receive further treatment from Severus Snape. His skill in DADA may have also aided in his ability to cast the extremely powerful protection spell that kept Harry Potter save from even Voldemort himself for years with the only way for the spell to not keep Harry save from Voldemort being Harry willingly leaving the house where the enchantment would protect him with no desire to return or Harry had reached the age of seventeen.<br><br><br>
<li><b>CAre Of magical Creatures: </b>Dumbledore had good knowledge and skills with interacting with magical creatures. This was shown as he kept Fawkes the Phoenix as a pet, and interacted with creatures such as Thestrals, Merpeople, Centaurs and possibly Goblins, considering he could speak both Mermish and Gobbledegook. He sometimes used Thestrals as a mode of transport when not apparating, communicated with the Merpeople in Mermish during the Triwizard Tournament second task in order to get the results from the champions, and hired the Centaur, Firenze, to teach Divination in Hogwarts. He also interacted with House-elves with kindness and compassion, giving Dobby and Winky jobs at Hogwarts and encouraged Harry to treat Kreacher more kindly. However, while he was good at interacting with many magical creatures, Dumbledore despised dark creatures such as Dementors due to their depressive effects and untrustworthy natures.<br><br><br>
<li><b>Healing Magic: </b>Dumbledore had knowledge in healing magic as he managed to control the curse from Marvolo Gaunt's ring for a while before receiving further treatment from Severus Snape and easily healed his wound with a healing spell after using his blood to open the passageway when searching for Salazar Slytherin's Locket.<br><br><br>
<li><b>Apparition: </b>Dumbledore could transport himself from one place to another with pinpoint precision, even when locked in combat. He used this ability to avoid some of Voldemort's spells during their duel before counter-attacking. He could also apparate silently[33] which only a master of Apparition could do. He could apparate within the Hogwarts Grounds.<br><br><br>
<li><b>Flying: </b>Dumbledore was a skilled broomstick flyer. Shortly before his death, he flew to the Hogwarts Astronomy tower, despite being weakened by a potion. He also was able to cast jinxes during flight.<br><br><br>
<li><b>Love: </b>Dumbledore was highly learned and knowledgeable in the nature of love along with the magic associated with it, and showed a very strong capability to feel true love. This was shown as he was able to understand the true magical power behind a loving sacrifice, telling Harry about the magical protection he had inherited when his mother sacrificed herself to protect him from Voldemort, and was also able to inform Harry that his own ability to love allowed him to close the connection between him and Voldemort and repel Voldemort's attempted possession of Harry by focusing on grief when he was unable to perform Occlumency. He was also able to distinguish between pure, unconditional love which most people felt for each other, and the obsession which was caused by Love Potions. While Dumbledore never had any love interests, apart from a brief crush on his former friend Gellert Grindelwald, he evidently cared greatly about his family, close friends, students, allies and the wizarding community. His ability to love gave him the strength to overcome his selfishness and obsession for power, and stand up to Grindelwald in order to protect his brother Aberforth when Grindelwald attacked him, duel Grindelwald again at the heights of his power and eventually defeat him when he was threatening to take over both wizarding and muggle worlds, and become a better person by protecting many people he cared about, especially when Voldemort rose to power. His ability to love also made him concerned about Harry Potter's safety, to the point that he kept the prophecy a secret from him earlier on, and distanced himself from Harry during his fifth year, hoping it would reduce the connection between Harry and Voldemort, along with protecting him several times.<br><br><br>
<li><b>Leadership Skills: </b>Dumbledore was considered by many to be the greatest Headmaster in Hogwarts' history. He founded and lead the Order of the Phoenix against Voldemort and his Death Eaters in both the first and second Wizarding Wars. He was also offered the position of Minister for Magic several times, but declined as he felt he could not be trusted with that sort of power. Following his death, he noted that he considered himself an inferior leader compared to Harry Potter, as he deliberately sought power where Harry led others only after he was elevated to the position of leadership by outside circumstances. His leadership skills and charisma was so pronounced that whenever he made a decision, most people would instantly trust his judgement.<br><br><br>
<li><b>Teaching Skills: </b>Before becoming the headmaster of Hogwarts, Dumbledore taught Transfiguration as the subject's Professor, which implies he was a very capable teacher, as his performance on the job was impressive enough that he was one of the few Professors trusted by Armando Dippet, the headmaster of the time, who was known to distrust almost all of his fellow staff members.<br><br><br>
<li><b>Physical aptitudes: </b>Despite his great age and rather skinny demeanour, Dumbledore seemed to possess the stamina and physical prowess of a young, fit athlete. He demonstrated strength and swimming abilities that should be far beyond his capabilities and was very agile as shown during the Battle of the Department of Mysteries.<br><br><br>

<h2><font face=serif>Possesions</font></h2>
<hr align="left" noshade color=DarkTurquoise width="100%" height=1px>
<br><br>
<p align=justify>
Dumbledore's office houses "a number of curious [...] instruments." Among them is a Pensieve, a stone receptacle used to store and review memories, which witches and wizards are able to extract from their heads as a type of fluid. Harry first discovers this device to witness Dumbledore's memory of Igor Karkaroff's trial before the Wizengamot, and also uses it to view Severus Snape's memories of childhood. During the private lessons between Harry and Dumbledore, the Pensieve was used to view a variety of memories about Tom Riddle's past.<br><br>
Dumbledore was also seen using the Deluminator, a device for removing and later returning light, and for use as a homing device. It is confirmed when the object is inherited by Ron that the Deluminator was of Dumbledore's own design. Dumbledore was the possessor and master of the Elder Wand, an extremely powerful object known also as the "Wand of Destiny" or the "Deathstick", and one of the Deathly Hallows, until he was Disarmed by Draco Malfoy at the top of the Astronomy Tower. The wand's allegiance was then transferred to Harry Potter nearly a year later. Unlike many of the wand's previous owners, Dumbledore kept its identity a closely guarded secret.<br><br>
He also had a pet phoenix named Fawkes, who left Hogwarts Castle after Dumbledore's death. It is revealed in that two of Fawkes' feathers form the magical cores of both Harry's and Voldemort's wands.<br><bR>
Professor Dumbledore kept a journal in which he would have written in regularly. He also kept a pocket watch with twelve hands, but instead of numbers it had little planets moving around the edge.<br><bR>
