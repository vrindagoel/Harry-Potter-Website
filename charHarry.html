			<p style="margin-left: 50px; margin-right:50px; color:grey">"You are protected, in short, by your ability to love! The only protection that can possibly work against the lure of power like Voldemort's! In spite of all the temptation you have endured, all the suffering, you remain pure of heart, just as pure as you were at the age of eleven, when you stared into a mirror that reflected your heart's desire, and it showed you only the way to thwart Lord Voldemort, and not immortality or riches."<br>&mdash;Description of Harry's deepest nature</p>
			Harry James Potter (b. 31 July 1980) is a half-blood wizard, and one of the most famous wizards of modern times. The only child and son of James and Lily Potter (previousle Evans), both respected members of the original Order of the Phoenix, Harry's birth was universally overshadowed by a recently made prophecy naming either him or his future classmate Neville Longbottom the sole person to bring about Lord Voldemort's downfall, which was partially overheard by then-Death Eater Severus Snape and reported to Voldemort himself. Chosen as the target due to his many similarities with the Dark Lord, he spent a portion of his infancy hiding with his parents in Godric's Hollow under a Fidelius Charm cast by Albus Dumbledore for their safety, which proved fatal when the charm's location was divulged to the Death Eaters by its Secret-Keeper. Voldemort made his first vain attempt to circumvent the prophecy when Harry was a year and three months old, during which he murdered his parents as they tried to protect him. but an unsuccessful attempt to vanquish Harry led to Voldemort's first downfall, marking the end of the First Wizarding War, and to Harry henceforth being known as the "Boy Who Lived.<br><br><br>
			One consequence of Lily's loving sacrifice was that her orphaned son had to be raised by her only remaining blood relative, his Muggle aunt Petunia Dursley. While in her care he would be protected from Lord Voldemort, due to the Bond of Blood charm Albus Dumbledore placed upon him. This powerful charm would protect him until he became of age, or no longer called his aunt's house home. As the only known survivor of the Killing Curse (up to that point), Harry was already famous before he arrived at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.<br><br><br>
			On his eleventh birthday, Harry learned that he was a wizard. He began attending Hogwarts in 1991 and was Sorted into Gryffindor House. While at school, Harry became best friends with Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, and later became the youngest Quidditch Seeker in over a century and eventually the captain of his house's team, winning two Quidditch Cups. He became even better known in his early years for protecting the Philosopher's Stone from Voldemort, saving Ron's sister Ginny Weasley, solving the mystery of the Chamber of Secrets, slaying Salazar Slytherin's basilisk, and learning how to conjure a corporeal stag Patronus at the age of thirteen. In his fourth year, Harry won the Triwizard Tournament, although the competition ended with the tragic death of Cedric Diggory and the return of Lord Voldemort. During the next school year, Harry reluctantly taught and led Dumbledore's Army. He also fought in the Battle of the Department of Mysteries, during which he lost his godfather, Sirius Black.<br><br><br>
			Harry played a significant role in many other battles of the Second Wizarding War. He, Ron, and Hermione hunted down and destroyed Voldemort's Horcruxes. During the Battle of Hogwarts Harry personally saw the deaths of Severus Snape and Fred Weasley, and learned that Remus Lupin, Nymphadora Tonks, Colin Creevey, and many others had fallen in battle as well. He encountered Voldemort and sacrificed himself, knowing that his doing so was the only way to destroy the fragment of Voldemort's soul inside him. In limbo, after Voldemort cursed him in the forest clearing, Albus Dumbledore gave Harry advice and background information on the Dark Lord. When told he could choose to live or to "move on", Harry chose to live. After he awoke he confronted Voldemort and defeated him once and for all. Harry was also notable for being the only known Master of Death, having united the three Deathly Hallows at the mere age of seventeen.<br><br><br>
			After the war, Harry became an Auror and helped reform and revolutionise the Ministry of Magic. At some point, he married Ginny Weasley, with whom he had three children: James Sirius (named after his father and godfather), Albus Severus (named after Albus Dumbledore and Severus Snape), and Lily Luna (named after his mother and Luna Lovegood). He was also named the godfather of Edward Remus Lupin. In 2007 Harry was promoted to Head of the Auror Office at the age of 26, and would occasionally deliver Defence Against the Dark Arts lectures at Hogwarts. He later went on to be Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement by the summer of 2020.

<h2><font face=serif >Personality And Traits</font></h2>
<hr align="left" noshade color=DarkTurquoise width="100%" height=1px>

<p style="margin-left: 50px; margin-right:50px; color:grey">"I see Harry as someone who is struggling to do the right thing, who is not without faults, who acts impetuously as you would expect someone of his age to act, but who is ultimately a very loyal person, and a very very courageous person. So, in as much as he has qualities that I admire most I would say he is a good role model. That doesn't mean that he is saintly, but then frankly, who is? But I think you do see enough of Harry's inner life, the workings of his mind in the books to know that he is ultimately human, struggling to do the right thing, which I think is admirable."<br>&mdash;J. K. Rowling on why Harry's an excellent role model</p>
Harry was an extremely brave, loyal, and selfless person who possessed tremendous strength of character. He willingly went to what he truly believed to be his death, because he believed that this was the only way to defeat the Dark Lord. Harry was also marked by what Lord Voldemort once deemed a "weakness for heroics" — he would go to great lengths and take great risks in order to help others, particularly his loved ones. Notably, this was taken advantage of by Voldemort in 1996, when he lured Harry to the Department of Mysteries by making him believe that his godfather was in danger. Harry was also very strong-willed and unafraid to stand up for himself. The fact that he was capable of repelling the Imperius Curse suggests that he had an unusually strong sense of himself and his morals. Dumbledore once made parallels between Harry's traits and qualities that Salazar Slytherin looked for in his own hand-picked students. He also noted that Harry's choice not to draw on those qualities really defined who he was, rather than the simple fact that he had them.<br>
<p style="margin-left: 50px; margin-right:50px; color:grey">"Hmm. Difficult. Very difficult. Plenty of courage, I see. Not a bad mind either. There's talent, oh my goodness, yes — and a nice thirst to prove yourself, now that's interesting... So where shall I put you?"<br>&mdash; The Sorting Hat looking into Harry's mind</p>
Harry was perfectly prepared to put his friends' needs and best interests first, shown by how he ended his relationship with Ginny Weasley, due to his concern for her well being (even though being with her was one of the best things that ever happened to him).[99] The amount of trust that Harry put into his friends was so strong that he absolutely refused to consider that any of them would betray him to Voldemort. Considering that Harry knew a person (Peter Pettigrew) who had betrayed all of his closest friends to Voldemort, his closest friends being Harry's parents, godfather, and Remus Lupin who was there when Harry declared his trust in him, proves Harry's ability to love so unequivocally.<br><br><br>
The closeness that Harry felt for many was great enough for him to behave violently if any of them were harmed. When his godfather was murdered by Bellatrix Lestrange, Harry attacked her in a grief-stricken rage of righteous anger and attempted to use the Cruciatus Curse on her. He also attacked Severus Snape after the latter murdered Albus Dumbledore. Ironically, the only people with whom Harry ever initiated a duel were Snape and Bellatrix and he only desired to do so right after they killed someone he loved. This highlights Harry's bravery even further because Harry was fully aware that Snape and Bellatrix were two very skilled and experienced duellists, but did not hesitate to harm them as soon as he was pushed into it.<br>
<p style="margin-left: 50px; margin-right:50px; color:grey">"Listen to me, Harry. You happen to have many qualities Salazar Slytherin prized in his hand-picked students. His own very rare gift, Parseltongue; resourcefulness; determination; a certain disregard for the rules..."<br>&mdash; Dumbledore discussing some of Harry's personality traits</p>
However, Harry was also accused of being arrogant, in particular by Severus Snape (although in fairness, Snape was extremely biassed, and Harry often found being famous and admired very difficult), and could be hot-tempered and impulsive. This could sometimes make him rude to authority figures such as Professor Snape and Minister for Magic Rufus Scrimgeour. In contrast, Dumbledore stated that "many teachers report that [Harry's] modest, likeable, and reasonably talented".<br><br><br>
Harry was prone to moodiness and unkind remarks towards even his friends during his adolescence, though this is likely the result of the great emotional stress and trials he endured during this period. Harry was also not one to let bygones be bygones. He had at best a vengeful and at worst a spiteful streak towards those who did him wrong. This varied from wanting to murder/torture those whom had performed unforgivable acts like: Bellatrix, Voldemort, and Dolores Umbridge to a desire for pettiness towards: Ron Weasley, Draco Malfoy, Snape, and the Dursley's. Harry even wanted Sirius (before learning of his innocence) and Pettigrew to suffer the Dementor's kiss for their crimes and spent the entirety of the Horcrux hunt angry at Dumbledore for the latter's lack of trust.<br><br><br>
<b>Outward appearance : </b> Rowling also gave Harry Potter an uncanny outward appearance. Throughout the entire series, Harry sports his father's perpetually untidy black hair, his mother's green eyes, and a lightning bolt-shaped scar on his forehead because of his encounter with Lord Voldemort and round, thick eyeglasses. She explained that this image simply came to her when she first thought up Harry Potter, seeing him as a "scrawny, black-haired, bespectacled boy". <br>In the books, Harry's scar serves as an indicator of Voldemort's presence: it burns when the Dark Lord is near or feeling particularly murderous or exultant. According to Rowling, by attacking Harry when he was a baby, Voldemort gave him "tools (that) no other wizard possesed the scar, and the ability it conferred, provided a magical window into Voldemort's mind." Asked why Harry's forehead scar is lightning bolt-shaped, Rowling said, "to be honest, because it's a cool shape," and joked, "I couldn't have my hero sport a doughnut-shaped scar."<br><br><br>
<b>Abilities and interests : </b>In the books, Harry is categorised as a "half-blood" wizard in the series, because although both his parents were magical, his mother, Lily Evans, was "Muggle-born". According to Rowling, to characters for whom wizarding blood purity matters, Lily would be considered "as loathsome as a Muggle", and derogatively referred to as a "Mudblood".<br>Throughout the series, Rowling wrote Harry Potter as a gifted wizard apprentice. She stated in a 2000 interview with South West News Service that Harry Potter is "particularly talented" in Defence Against the Dark Arts, and also good in Quidditch.[25] Rowling said in the same interview that until about halfway through the third book, his good friend Hermione Granger –written as the smartest student in Harry's year– would have beaten Harry in a magical duel. From the fourth book onwards, Rowling admits Harry has become quite talented in the Defence Against the Dark Arts and would beat his friend Hermione in a magical duel. His power is evident from the beginning of the series; specifically, Harry shows immediate command of a broomstick, produces a Patronus at an early age and survives several confrontations with Voldemort. Harry is able to speak and understand Parseltongue, a language associated with Dark Magic, which, according to Rowling, is because he harbours a piece of Lord Voldemort's soul. After Voldemort destroys that soul piece in the seventh book's climax, Harry loses the ability to speak Parseltongue. Harry "is very glad" to have lost this gift.<br><br><br>

<h2><font face=serif>Magical Abilities And Skills</font></h2>
<hr align="left" noshade color=DarkTurquoise width="100%" height=1px>
<p style="margin-left: 50px; margin-right:50px; color:grey">"Harry.... is becoming exceptionally good at Defence Against the Dark Arts. So that's the one area in which, almost instinctively, he is particularly talented. Apart from Quidditch."<br>&mdash; J. K. Rowling regarding Harry's magical talents</p>
Harry was seen and had proven himself to be an very talented and powerful wizard. His power was evident from the start: he demonstrated immediate command of a broomstick, was able to conjure a corporeal Patronus at an exceptionally young age (a mark of superior magical ability[92]), and even survived numerous encounters with Lord Voldemort. He mastered a wand made of hawthorn, which one should only ever consider placing in the hands of a witch or wizard of proven talent.[107] Harry was also a very gifted flyer and Quidditch player, the youngest Seeker in a century.<br><br><br>
<ol>
<li><b>Love:</b> Harry's greatest power of all was his ability to love. In spite of being raised by a family that treated him with anything but affection, Harry remarkably turned out capable of very strong love. For example, Harry's love for his friends caused him to sacrifice himself to Lord Voldemort. His love for his friends also caused him to feel no concern for his own well being or happiness when they were at risk, and put himself in danger many times to protect them. This loving sacrifice conferred a certain amount of protection onto his allies, making it so that spells Voldemort tried to place on them quickly wore off.[108] Harry's ability to love has also protected and helped him on several occasions, such as when he produced a Patronus that could drive hundreds of Dementors away,[56] repelled Voldemort when he possessed him,[100] and allowed himself to close the connection between himself and Voldemort when he was unable to perform Occlumency. His love was strongest when directed at Ginny Weasley, who was the driving force that kept him going until Voldemort was defeated.<br><br><br>
<li><b>Auror Skills:</b>Auror skills: Harry was extremely young for an Auror, which spoke highly of his magical abilities. He became head of the Auror Office at the age of 26. During his time as an Auror, he gained skills in various areas of magic such as, Concealment and Disguise, Stealth and Tracking, and poisons and antidotes. All of these areas of magic were essential studies for Aurors. He also had high skill in Transfiguration, as Aurors had to frequently transfigure and untransfigure things in their line of work. Harry also possessed a great instinct for the right thing to do when faced with stressful and difficult situations, something that contributed to him becoming a fantastic Auror.<br><br><br>
<li><b>Defence Against The Dark Arts:</b> Harry was extremely adept in Defence Against the Dark Arts, having mastered all manners of spells, such as the: Stunning Spell, Disarming Charm, Impediment Jinx, Full Body-Bind Curse, and Reductor Curse.[111] In fact, his Stunning Spell was so strong that opponents would get knocked out if they were hit directly. He was also skilled at defending himself against Dark creatures such as: Grindylows, Red Caps, Hinkypunks, Boggarts, Erklings, and Dementors. In his third year, he was the only student who flawlessly made it through the end-of-the-year exam (an obstacle course containing some of the said creatures.[112]) In his fifth year, Professor McGonagall stated that Professor Lupin said he showed a "pronounced aptitude" for the subject, and that he had "achieved high marks on all his Defence Against the Dark Arts tests".[113] In fact, Harry had beaten Hermione in two of the three Defence Against the Dark Arts exams they had taken together. The only exam she beat him in was their first year exam and Hermione later reflected that it did not count as Quirrell "wasn't a particularly good teacher".[114] During his O.W.L. examination, Professor Tofty (Wizarding Examinations Authority) expressed pleasure at Harry's performance of Defence Against the Dark Arts, calling it "excellent".[115] This statement was later proven true when he achieved an 'Outstanding'[86] Defence Against the Dark Arts O.W.L. (something that not even Hermione achieved), a testament of his extraordinary talent in defensive magic. In 1996, Ron stated that it came as no surprise that Harry was top of the class at Defence Against the Dark Arts.[86] Indeed, Harry was so good at DADA that when the Ministry of Magic prevented the subject from being taught effectively in 1995, he set up his own DADA club and successfully taught members how to defend themselves against the Dark Arts. He immediately became an Auror after the Second Wizarding War, which also required considerable skill in both defensive and offensive magic. Harry also developed a high level of resistance towards the Imperius Curse as well, demonstrated when it was cast upon him by Barty Crouch Jr (disguised as Alastor Moody) in 1994 and by Lord Voldemort himself in 1995.<br><br><br>
<li><b>Duelling</b> Despite his young age, Harry was an accomplished and skilful duellist. He was able to single-handedly defeat some of the most formidable Death Eaters and even survive numerous encounters with Lord Voldemort himself. He eventually defeated Voldemort by becoming the master of the Elder Wand. In many battles of the Second Wizarding War, he was able to incapacitate much more experienced Death Eaters. During the Battle of the Department of Mysteries, he was the only one of the six D.A. members to be neither injured nor incapacitated and, along with Albus Dumbledore and Remus Lupin, was the only fighter on their side to emerge from the battle physically unscathed. In that time he had defeated Lucius Malfoy and had defeated the extremely powerful Antonin Dolohov twice. Later, in the same battle, he was able to hold his own against Bellatrix Lestrange, who was the most powerful of all the Death Eaters.[116] In 1997, Harry defeated Yaxley, Fenrir Greyback, and one of the two Carrows. He fought off several Death Eaters in the Battle of the Seven Potters. During the Skirmish at Malfoy Manor he overpowered Lucius Malfoy, Draco Malfoy, and Fenrir Greyback and avoided direct conflict damage all throughout the Battle of Hogwarts (ensuring that mastery of the Elder Wand did not waver from him[45]). He was known to be very quick off the draw and had an aggressive duelling style, even incorporating Unforgivable Curses. He was also known to taunt his opponents and get them to talk at length, angering them and throwing them mentally off-balance, buying himself time to strategise or lulling them into lowering their guard. Harry was especially skilled in the Disarming Charm and used it so much that it was seen as his "signature spell" by many Death Eaters. His most notable uses of the Disarming Charm were when he formed Priori Incantatem with Voldemort and when he finally killed the Dark Lord. At the remarkably young age of seventeen Harry became an Auror and, in 2007, was promoted to Head of the Auror Office at the age of 26 or 27.<br><br><br>
<li><b>Dark Arts:</b> Harry was one of the few non-Dark Wizards who was highly proficient in the Dark Arts at all levels. On top of being able to cast simple curses and jinxes like the; Leg-Locker Curse, Furnunculus Curse, Knockback Jinx, Revulsion Jinx, and Melofors Jinx, he could cast more powerful spells such as the Blasting Curse.[117] He was also able to flawlessly cast the jinxes and curses in the Half-Blood Prince's copy of Advanced Potion-Making.[102] Harry even used two of the three Unforgivable Curses, such as the Imperius Curse on Travers and a goblin called Bogrod during the 1998 Break-in of Gringotts Wizarding Bank,[118] as well as the Cruciatus Curse on several occasions. However, his first successful attempt was in 1998 against Amycus Carrow, but it did not result in the prolonged, excruciating pain that the curse was famous for — instead, Carrow screamed and was incapacitated.[119] He has never used the Killing Curse for obvious reasons, even in his final battle with Voldemort.<br><br><br>
<li><b>Flying:</b> Harry had inherited his father's talent for flying and for Quidditch. Harry showed immediate command of a broomstick in his first year, which made him a naturally good Seeker. This was the first magical skill for which he discovered an aptitude, as he found in 1991. In fact, at the mere age of eleven, Harry became the youngest Seeker in a century.[120] His extraordinary flying skills aided him when he had to capture Winged Keys to get past Professor Flitwick's challenge in the Philosopher's Stone Chambers, and also helped him in the Triwizard Tournament (where he had to steal a golden egg from a Hungarian Horntail), and during the Battle of Hogwarts, during which he managed to escape a Fiendfyre inferno in the Room of Requirement.<br><br><br>
<li><b>Parselmouth</b> Because he carried a piece of Voldemort's soul within himself, Harry was able to speak and understand Parseltongue from 1981 to 1998. After that soul fragment was destroyed, Harry lost this ability. However, in 2020, Harry had somehow regained the ability to speak Parseltongue again, although it was possible he never lost to begin with or that the ability simply became temporarily suppressed after the Horcrux was destroyed.<br><br><br>
<li><b>Insight into Voldemort's mind:</b> Also due to the piece of Voldemort's soul, Harry was able to look into Voldemort's mind and see through his senses from time to time. He sometimes used this ability to monitor what Voldemort was doing. However, it was a dangerous ability to have as well; Voldemort once used it, along with Legilimency, to plant a false vision in Harry's mind of Sirius Black being tortured, which he used to lure Harry to the Department of Mysteries.[121] Additionally, because of their connection, Harry felt a burning pain in his scar whenever he and Voldemort were in close proximity or whenever Voldemort felt strong negative emotions. Harry lost this ability as well when the soul fragment within him was destroyed. Harry also possessed a non-magical insight into Voldemort's mind from the information Dumbledore shared with him during their lessons. This insight allowed Harry to figure out that a Horcrux was stored at Gringotts Wizarding Bank after which Ron and Hermoine noted Harry's understanding of Voldemort causing to Harry admit that he did understand parts of Voldemort.<br><br><br>
<li><b>Master of Death:</b> Harry mastered all three Deathly Hallows and accepted his own death.[45] First, he inherited the Cloak of Invisibility from his father, James. Then, he inherited the Resurrection Stone from Dumbledore, which was inside a snitch. Finally, he won the Elder Wand from Draco Malfoy during the Skirmish at Malfoy Manor. All three were directly or indirectly employed by Harry in the Forbidden Forest: he was wearing the Cloak, using the Stone, and was preparing to be killed by the Wand, which he had already won.[122] The only Hallow he choose to keep was the cloak as it was a priceless family heirloom; the stone was lost in the forest and the wand returned to Dumbledore's tomb.[108]<br><br>
<li><b>Potions:</b> Harry's Potions ability was apparently better than it appeared. He achieved an 'Exceeds Expectations'[86] on his O.W.L. exam — proof of his proficiency in the subject. He was one of only twelve students able to reach the required level to take N.E.W.T. potions.[12] He improved greatly during his sixth year when he came into possession of the Half-Blood Prince's copy of Advanced Potion-Making, that had revised versions of potions curtsey of the Half-Blood Prince (Severus Snape). However, the usage of this textbook was noted by both Hermione and Snape to be cheating, and when forced to hide it Harry's potion skills suffered. It was revealed, that even without the Prince's book, Harry was still able to do a decent enough job at potion-making that Slughorn's suspicions were not raised. Apparently Harry had no problems with potions at all as long as Snape was not around.[113][115]<br><br><br>
<li><b>Transfiguration:</b> Harry achieved an 'Exceeds Expectations'[86] on his O.W.L. exam, showing proficiency in the subject and advanced to N.E.W.T.-level. He was able to perform Conjuration an advanced type of Transfiguration. In his sixth year Harry demonstrated this by conjuring ropes and water.[123] He could also vanish objects, which is one of the most complicated spells taught at Ordinary Wizarding Level. In 1996, Harry vanished the whole of an iguana[115] and in 1997 a snake that crossed his path. He could also transform objects into other objects for example, he can cast the Avifors Spell.[124] Harry is also skilled enough to perform human Transfiguration, which is noted to be "immensely difficult". He accomplished this during a 1996 Transfiguration lesson, were he succeeded in turning his eyebrow bright yellow.[14] Minerva McGonagall herself complimented him on his Transfiguration ability.[12] After having travelled back in time to 1981 Harry uses human Transfiguration to an impressive degree to disguise himself as Voldemort.[125]<br><br>
<li><b>Charms:</b> Harry achieved an 'Exceeds Expectations'[86] on his O.W.L. exam and advanced to N.E.W.T.-level. He proved to be particularly talented in this subject. Harry frequently used the Summoning Charm successfully, would occasionally cast the protective enchantments that Hermione used during the Horcrux hunt[23][126], and was able to cast the Confundus Charm.[118] He displayed an impressive mastery of the Shield Charm, surpassing that of many Ministry employees:[127] his Shield Charms were so powerful that they were able to deflect curses from Lord Voldemort himself.[108] During the Battle of the Seven Potters, he was able to levitate a side-car with himself in it for a long stretch of time. He could also cast simpler charms such as the; Wand-Lighting Charm, Colour Change Charm, Banishing Charm, Refilling Charm, and various others. Under the teaching of Remus Lupin, Harry was able to conjure an extremely powerful corporeal Patronus in his third year (in the form of a stag), which was a remarkable feat and yet another proof of his talent, given that many talented adult wizards were unable to cast the difficult charm successfully.[92]<br><br><br>
<li><b>Healing magic:</b> Harry was able to effectively cast healing spells. After he saw Nymphadora Tonks perform the Episkey spell on his own broken nose, he fixed Demelza Robins' broken lip in 1996 with the same spell, which is used to treat mild to moderate injuries.[128] He also used the healing spell for clearing up dried blood from a bleeding wound.[76]<br><br><br>
<li><b>Apparition:</b> Harry had not earned a licence to apparate, but he used the ability frequently during 1997 and 1998 to great success, even when forced to apparate with only a few seconds' notice or while guiding others.[45] He also used apparition in his sixth year to a very impressive degree, to get himself and a weakened Albus Dumbledore over an incredibly vast distance even though he was inexperienced.<br><br><br>
<li><b>Non-verbal and wandless magic:</b> In 1995, when the Dementors attacked in Little Whinging, Dudley had knocked Harry's wand out of his hand when he punched him moments before. In desperation, Harry calls out "Lumos!" Although his wand was not in his hand, the wand tip lit up.[129] During 1997 and 1998, Harry began using spells non-verbally and became quite proficient at it when Snape was not bothering him.[45] He used both non-verbal and wandless magic in 1991, when he caused the glass window of a snake's cage at the zoo to vanish, and again in 1993, when he inflated Marge Dursley, although both of these occurrences were accidents fuelled by pure anger. Few other wizards have exhibited this power, although Dumbledore and Voldemort were among them. This further testifies to Harry's skill, as only some of the most powerful wizards of his time were able to do so. As an adult Harry displays the ability to consciously use wandless magic; shown when he straightened his work-space with the simple wave of a hand.<br><br><br>
<li><b>Care of Magical Creatures:</b> Harry achieved an 'Exceeds Expectations'[86] on his O.W.L. exam, he has shown on more than one occasion to have good skill in handling numerous sorts of magical creatures. For example, he was the first in his class to tame a hippogriff, which he did very excellently.[131] He befriended the hippogriff, Buckbeak, to the extent that Buckbeak defended him when he was in danger. Harry has also shown on three occasions that he is quite competent at dealing with dragons. This is shown when he was able to help Hagrid take care of baby Norbert the dragon, outsmart the Hungarian Horntail in the Triwizard Tournament, and tame a half-blind dragon into helping the trio escape Gringotts by flying out on its back. He was also one of very few in his class who was able to see Thestrals, and had no trouble mounting his in June 1996. Harry was also good with House-elves, befriending the house-elf Dobby and eventually freeing him, which made the little elf so loyal to him that he gave his life to save him.[109] He also earned the respect and loyalty of Kreacher, a very difficult task.<br><br><br>
<li><b>Herbology:</b> Harry attended N.E.W.T. Herbology classes. He achieved an 'Exceeds Expectations'[86] on his O.W.L. exam, showing aptitude in the subject. In 1998 Harry was able to recognise a Snargaluff plant at the Lovegood House and knew to gave it a wide berth of space.[132] He also had knowledge of plants such as: Devil's Snare, Gillyweed, Venomous Tentacula, and Fanged Geranium from hands on experience. He could cast plant-related spells such as the Fire-Making Spell[133] and Herbivicus Charm.<br><br><br>
<li><b>Astronomy:</b> Though not excellent at Astronomy, Harry was able to pass his O.W.L. exam with an 'Acceptable'.[86] Although it was stated that he didn't finish his exam, due to the fact that he was distracted by Dolores Umbridge's attempt to arrest Hagrid during the time the exam was being taken. It is not known if he was able to advance to the N.E.W.T class or not, seeing as he did not apply for advancement.<br><br><br>
<li><b>Wand versatility:</b> Harry was able to use Hermione's wand after his was broken during the Attack at Godric's Hollow in 1997. He was able to use spells such as: the Wand-Lighting Charm, the Shield Charm, and the Severing Charm at full strength, despite not having won the wand's allegiance.[19] He also gained the allegiance of Draco Malfoy's wand, the Elder Wand, and quite possibly Voldemort's wand by defeating the previous masters.<br><br><br>
<li><b>Expert detective skills:</b> Harry, along with Ron and Hermione, was also a formidably talented investigator. While in school, the trio had a knack for solving difficult mysteries and discovering the truth despite all attempts by others to conceal it, with Hermione generally finding the background information while Harry put the pieces together to make a coherent picture. In his first year, Harry uncovered the truth about the Philosopher's Stone and saved it from Voldemort. Over the next six years, he would solve the mystery of the Chamber of Secrets,[134] find the truth about the prophecy, and hunt down and destroy all of Voldemort's Horcruxes using his amazing deductive skills. Harry's deductive skills also allowed him to uncover the mystery of the Deathly Hallows[101] and learn that he mastered the three of them when even Ron and Hermione were initially sceptical of their existence. Harry also had a knack for spotting things that others did not, and had a sharp eye for details, as he was able to tell that Luna Lovegood had not been home in weeks by the state of her room,[135] and he became suspicious when Dobby revealed that he had known that Harry was not getting any letters in 1992. His intelligence allowed him to intuitively know that Draco Malfoy had been branded with the Dark Mark despite no solid proof, that Malfoy was using the Room of Requirement as a work shop, and that he was having Crabbe and Goyle use Polyjuice Potion in order to disguise themselves as girls while keeping watch outside the room.[136]<br><br><br>
<li><b>Resourcefulness:</b> Harry showed resourcefulness in many different situations. In his first year, Harry impersonated the Bloody Baron, warning Peeves to stay away from the third floor that night so he wouldn't inconvenience the trio on their quest to save the Philosopher's Stone.[137] In his second year, when encountering Professor McGonagall on his and Ron's way to Moaning Myrtle's bathroom, he lied and said that that they were on their way to see Hermione in the hospital wing[138] also in his second year, he used a basilisk fang to destroy Riddle's Diary.[139] In his fifth year, while under interrogation from Umbridge, he relayed a coded message to Snape in an attempt to warn him and by extension the Order, that Voldemort had Sirius. In the same year, while surrounded by Death Eaters Harry came up with the plan to smash the shelves in the Hall of Prophecy as a distraction so that he and the D.A. could try and escape. During the hunt for Horcruxes, he used the Godric Gryffindor's Sword as a way of retrieving Helga Hufflepuff's cup from the mounds of burning treasure and used the half-blind Dragon as a means to escape from Gringotts Wizarding Bank.[118] Harry was also cunning enough that the Sorting Hat heavily considered Sorting him into Slytherin house.[63]<br><br><br>
<li><b>Leadership skills:</b> While Harry never deliberately set out to be a leader to others, he had often taken charge when the situation required it. This began with his impulsive decision to find and warn Hermione about the presence of a troll in the school during the 1991 Hallowe'en feast. It progressed to the point where over thirty students, some of them in their sixth and seventh years — respect him as a teacher in Dumbledore's Army despite his being younger than they were.[140] Dumbledore later noted that Harry was a superior leader to him. Dumbledore had deliberately sought power in his youth and subsequently avoided anything more demanding than his role as Hogwarts headmaster — while Harry had leadership thrust upon. Harry accepted the burden of command, acknowledging his responsibilities towards those who "followed" him. He did this regardless of how uncomfortable he might feel about the prospect and coordinating his efforts against his enemies well, when left with no other option but to take control.[20] Harry's natural talents later served the rest of the wizarding community of Great Britain. In 2007 he was promoted to the Head of the Auror Office, at age 26 and was later made the Head of Magical Law Enforcement.[141] His promotion to these positions of power at relatively young ages demonstrate Harry's natural talent as a commander.<br><br><br>
<li><b>Indomitable will:</b> Harry appears to possess an unbreakable spirit and, though not above depression, he has never truly given up on any mission. He's been shown to rise from defeat and loss, such as the deaths of many loved ones, even stronger than before. His indomitable will is exemplified by his ability to resist the Imperius Curse, and also by the fact that he had never begged for mercy even in life-and-death situations, but fought back in defiance, as well as perform non-verbal spells flawlessly.[45] His inability to perform Occlumency (despite possessing the required willpower) is due to his inability to keep his emotions under control.<br><br><br>
<li><b>Teaching skills:</b> Harry has shown tremendous skill in teaching others. Having mastered many spells at a young age, Harry successfully passed them onto others even when he was still a student himself, giving proper instructions and corrections on how to perform many fields of magic, ranging from the relatively simplistic Disarming Charm to the highly advanced Patronus Charm.[116] Harry's effectiveness as a teacher led many, some even older than him, to choose him over the Ministry-installed professional Dolores Umbridge, and he even returned to Hogwarts to give occasional lectures.<br><br><br>

<h2><font face=serif>Possesions</font></h2>
<hr align="left" noshade color=DarkTurquoise width="100%" height=1px>
<br><br>
<ol>
<li><b>Potter Legacy:</b> When Harry's parents were murdered by Lord Voldemort, they left behind a small fortune in Vault 687 of Gringotts Wizarding Bank. This inheritance became Harry's source of funding for all his Hogwarts textbooks, wizarding clothes, etc.<br><br><br>
<li><b>Wand:</b> As is the case with most wizards and witches, Harry's wand is among his most valued magical possessions. His wand is made of holly, a wood with the powers to repel evil.[142] The wand is in deliberate contrast to the wand of Lord Voldemort, which is yew: a wood with the powers of evil. Harry's wand shared a twin core with Voldemort's wand, as both contained phoenix feathers from the same phoenix, Fawkes. Harry's wand broke in 1997 during a skirmish with Nagini in Bathilda Bagshot's house due to a stray spell cast by Hermione Granger. Later he used the Elder Wand to repair it.<br><br><br>
<li><b>Draco Malfoy's wand:</b> In 1998 Harry won the hawthorn wand's allegiance after overpowering Draco Malfoy during the Skirmish at Malfoy Manor. This wand was carried by him for the remainder of the Second Wizarding War; seeing action in the break-in at Gringotts, as well as during the final climactic Battle of Hogwarts. It is unknown what happened to the wand after Harry repaired his wand.<br><br><br>
<li><b>Photo album:</b> In June of 1992 Hagrid gave this album as a gift to Harry. The album contained pictures of his parents, Ron Weasley, Hermione Granger, and himself.<br><br><br>
<li><b>Marauder's Map:</b> One of Harry's most treasured possessions. In his third year, Fred Weasley and George Weasley gave it to Harry while he was trying to sneak into Hogsmeade. It was confiscated by Remus Lupin, but later returned when Lupin quit his job. Harry kept it with him for a long period of time, keeping it in the mokeskin wallet he had gotten from Hagrid, until it was finally stolen from his desk by his son, James.<br><br><br>
<li><b>Cloak of Invisibility:</b> Another valued and useful possession is Harry's Cloak of Invisibility. In his first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, he received it as an anonymous Christmas gift. He later learned the gift came from Albus Dumbledore, who obtained it in turn from Harry's father, James Potter. It was later revealed to be a family heirloom as well as one of the three Deathly Hallows. From this Harry realises he is a direct descendant of Ignotus Peverell, one of the three brothers who created the Deathly Hallows. Harry later gave the Cloak to his eldest son, James Sirius.<br><br><br>
<li><b>Hedwig:</b> Harry's animal companion, Hedwig was vitally helpful in delivering messages and packages for Harry, especially while Sirius was in hiding from the Ministry. Hedwig loved Harry dearly, showing signs by nibbling his ear or fingers, and loyally obeyed his every command (even pecking Ron and Hermione until they answer back). Harry loved her as much as she loved him. Hedwig was killed during the Battle of the Seven Potters by a stray Killing Curse that was most likely meant for Hagrid. Harry was overcome with grief over Hedwig's death.<br><br><br>
<li><b>Deathly Hallows:</b> For a brief time, Harry was master of all three Deathly Hallows: the Cloak of Invisibility, the Resurrection Stone, and the Elder Wand (though he was not in physical possession of the Elder Wand until after losing the Resurrection Stone). These three artefacts are the most powerful magical items in all of the wizarding world and were so ancient that they were only the subject of fairy tales. When Harry lost the Resurrection Stone inside the Forbidden Forest, he decided to leave it there. Harry also interred the Elder Wand in Albus Dumbledore's grave, so the power of the wand would be extinguished after Harry's eventual death. However, the portrait of Dumbledore that hangs in the Headmaster's office advised Harry to keep the Invisibility cloak, since it was his father's.<br><br><br>
<li><b>Godric Gryffindor's Sword:</b> A relic of the founder of Harry's house, the goblin-made sword of Godric Gryffindor was left to Harry by his former Headmaster Albus Dumbledore in his will. However, the Ministry of Magic claimed that it was not Dumbledore's to give, and that it truly belonged to Hogwarts. Although the Ministry confiscated a replica of the sword, the true sword found its way into Harry's possession still through the machinations of Severus Snape. Soon after, Ron Weasley used it to destroy Slytherin's Locket, one of Voldemort's Horcruxes. Harry lost the sword to Griphook when he, Ron and Hermione Granger stole Hufflepuff's Cup from the Lestrange Vault at Gringotts. However, the sword reappeared in the hands of Neville Longbottom during the Battle of Hogwarts; he used it to kill Nagini, and thus destroyed the last of the Horcruxes. Neville was seen sitting beside the sword after the battle, but it is likely that it was returned to Hogwarts as a relic of the Founders, along with the remains of the other Founders' relics.<br><br><br>
<li><b>Sirius Black's enchanted knife:</b> This magical knife, with the power to open most mechanical locks and magical seals and which Harry received for Christmas from Sirius Black, was melted when Harry tried it on a locked door at the Department of Mysteries. The protective enchantments on the door were far stronger than the magic of the enchanted knife.<br><br><br>
<li><b>Firebolt:</b> During Harry's third year at Hogwarts, the Nimbus 2000 broomstick he'd been riding since his first year was destroyed by the Whomping Willow, and Sirius Black replaced it by giving Harry the finest broom available as an anonymous gift. The broom was one of Harry's most prized possessions for years. It was lost during the Battle of the Seven Potters. It is not known if Harry ever recovered or replaced it.<br><br><br>
<li><b>Nimbus 2000:</b> This broomstick was gifted to him from Professor McGonagall after agreeing to join the Gryffindor Quidditch team in 1991. He used it during his first and second years at Hogwarts. In his third year it blew into the Whomping Willow and was smashed to bits, breaking it beyond repair.<br><br><br>
<li><b>Communication mirror:</b> Harry also owns one in a pair of two-way mirrors, given to him by his godfather Sirius Black. The mirror was intended to be a means covert communication, but Harry broke it out of anger over Sirius' death. Harry did not realise the mirror could still work, although he kept a shard out of sentimentality. When Harry and several friends are captured at Malfoy Manor, at the time being used as a headquarters for Voldemort, Harry used the shard of mirror to communicate with Aberforth Dumbledore, who had the other mirror. Aberforth sent Dobby to rescue Harry and the other prisoners.<br><br><br>
<li><b>Golden Snitch:</b> This Snitch was caught by Harry during the 1991-1992 school year. It was later left to him in Albus Dumbledore's will, to posthumously ensure that Marvolo Gaunt's Ring would be safely delivered to him.<br><br><br>
<li><b>Watch:</b> This watch was used by Harry until it was destroyed in the Second Task of the Triwizard Tournament, since it was not waterproof and by May of 1995, he had discarded the watch entirely.<br><br><br>
<li><b>Dress robes:</b> Harry wore dress robes to the Yule Ball for the 1994 Triwizard Tournament, they were bottle green that matched his eyes. He also wore dress robes to Bill and Fleur's wedding in 1997. He also wore a set of dress robes to Slughorn's Christmas Party in 1996.<br><br><br>
<li><b>Fabian Prewett's watch:</b> Molly Weasley gave Harry the watch of her late brother Fabian Prewett for his seventeenth birthday. It has a dent in it, but Harry kept the watch, even into his thirties. The watch does not have arms; rather, it has stars.<br><br><br>
<li><b>Mokeskin pouch:</b> A birthday present from Hagrid. Harry kept it with him throughout the Deathly Hallows, and kept in it his treasures that were of no use to his search; the Snitch, the broken mirror, his broken wand, his mother's letter and the fake Horcrux. Harry also received a photo album, from Hagrid, which had photos of his parents and other family members.<br><br><br>
<li><b>Rucksack:</b> This rucksack was owned by Harry during the 1997-1998 school year. He packed it with everything he felt he would need during the hunt for Horcruxes. He almost lost it during the Battle of the Seven Potters, but managed to keep hold of it.<br><br><br>
<li><b>Potter family house:</b> Sometime following the war, Harry acquired his own house and raised his three children there alongside his wife, Ginny. This can be assumed due to Harry denying James' request to have Teddy move in with them in exchange for sharing a room with his younger brother, to which Harry replied that he would only allow the two Potter brothers to share a room when "[he wanted] the house demolished."<br><br><br>
<li><b>Black family residence:</b> Located at 12 Grimmauld Place, it and all the contents and furnishings of the house, including Kreacher (the family house-elf) became Harry's. Mundungus Fletcher would later try to steal many of Harry's inherited possessions, including Slytherin's Locket.<br><br><br>
<li><b>Black family inheritance:</b> Harry also inherited the remainder of Sirius' wealth in wizard's gold at Gringotts. Since Sirius was disowned at the age of sixteen, it is likely that this wealth was limited to the gold left to him by his uncle Alphard Black. However, that is open to debate because although Sirius Black was disinherited by his family, he ended up inheriting the 12 Grimmauld Place after their death, which might lead us to believe in the existence of forms of inheritance from his family other than what his uncle left him.<br><br><br>
<li><b>Sirius Black's motorbike:</b> As one of Sirius's possessions, it was left to Harry, presumably in his will. Despite the severe damage done to it in the Battle of the Seven Potters, Arthur Weasley managed to repair the bike and returned it to Harry.[68] Harry presumably learned to ride it sometime after the war. Given the ease with which he learned to fly a broomstick, ride animals such as hippogryphs and thestrals, and even a dragon, Harry likely learned how to ride with very little trouble at all.<br><br><br>
