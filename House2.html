			<p style="margin-left: 50px; margin-right:50px; color:grey">"Or yet in wise old Ravenclaw,<br>If you've a ready mind,<br>Where those of wit and learning,<br>Will always find their kind."<br>-The Sorting Hat</p>
			Ravenclaw is one of the four Houses of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, founded by Rowena Ravenclaw. Members of this house are characterised by their wit, learning, and wisdom. Its house colours are blue and bronze, and its symbol is an eagle.[4] The house ghost, who in life was the daughter of the house's founder Rowena Ravenclaw, is the Grey Lady[5]. Ravenclaw corresponds roughly to the element of air[6]; the House colours blue and bronze were chosen to represent the sky and eagle feathers respectively, both having much to do with air<br><br>

			<hr align="left" noshade color=DarkTurquoise width="100%" height=1px>
			Ravenclaw House prizes learning, wisdom, wit, and intellect in its members. Thus, many Ravenclaws tend to be academically motivated and talented students. They also pride themselves in being original in their ideas, and methods. It's not unusual to find Ravenclaw students practising especially different types of magic that other houses might shun. Hermione Granger, an extremely intelligent witch and the top student in her year, was sorted into Gryffindor, though she admitted that the Sorting Hat had seriously considered placing her in Ravenclaw.<br><br>
			Often hard-working and diligent, as often is the case with intellectuals with a predisposition for academics, some of the pupils sorted under the blue-bronzed eagle are known to be inclined to dismiss certain social expectation for the sake of satisfying their own intellectual curiosity. Some of these eventually also ended up being not only accepted, but even celebrated, in spite of being initially subjected to scorn for their various oddities. Luna Lovegood, for example, was one such student: Eccentric to put it at its mildest, she was a Ravenclaw student who initially was bullied for her open defiance of conventionality, but ultimately became a celebrated wizarding naturalists and renowned for her participation inthe legendary Battle of Hogwarts and past membership in Dumbledore's Army. Another example would be Professor Filius Flitwick, a half-goblin who might have faced scorn for his short stature earlier in life but went on to become a renowned Duelling Champion, and subsequently one of the finest and most knowledgable Charms Masters in the entirety of the wizarding world during his employment at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. (The best, according to some of his students).<br><br>
			Ravenclaws tend to be curious about the world and pay attention to the world around them. Ravenclaws are known to be logical and rational.<br><br>
			Even so, not all Ravenclaws were motivated by academical prowess. Examples on such individuals includes Gilderoy Lockhart and Cho Chang, both of whom sought to use the good name and renown of their house, the inherent expectations of certain academic prowess that comes with being sorted into it said as well as the often somewhat natural ability of its members to gain popularity among their peers, which particularly was the case of the former, proving true the fact that a good student not necessarily made a good witch or wizard.<br><br>
