			<p style="margin-left: 50px; margin-right:50px; color:grey">"You might belong in Hufflepuff,Where they are just and loyal,<br>Those patient Hufflepuffs are true,<br>And unafraid of toil"<br>â€”The Sorting Hat</p>
			Hufflepuff is one of the four Houses of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Its founder was the medieval witch Helga Hufflepuff. Hufflepuff is the most inclusive among the four houses; valuing hard work, dedication, patience, loyalty, and fair play rather than a particular aptitude in its members. The emblematic animal is a badger, and yellow and black are its colours. The Head of Hufflepuff is Pomona Sprout and the Fat Friar is the House's patron ghost.<br><br>
			Hufflepuff corresponds roughly to the element of earth,[3] and it is for that reason that the House colours were chosen: yellow represented wheat, while black was emblematic of soil.[4] The Hufflepuff points hourglass contains yellow diamonds.[5] Students sorted into Hufflepuff often demonstrate exceptional abilities in Herbology, owing to their correspondence to earth.<br><br>

			Students belonging to this house are known to be hard-working, friendly, loyal, honest and rather impartial. It may be that due to their values, Hufflepuffs are not as competitive as the other houses, and are more modest about their accomplishments. Hufflepuff is the most inclusive among the four houses; valuing hard work, dedication, patience, loyalty, and fair play rather than a particular aptitude in its students.<br><br>
			Hufflepuffs are known to have a strong moral code, and a sense of right and wrong. Hufflepuffs are usually accepting of everyone. Students in Hufflepuff are known to value everyone and treat them as equal.<br><br>
			Hufflepuff appears to have the least rivalry with the other houses, except in Quidditch, although the Triwizard Tournament did temporarily put a great deal of strain on the relationship between Gryffindor and Hufflepuff, due to unusual circumstances of the selection of both Gryffindor student Harry Potter and Hufflepuff student Cedric Diggory as Champions. This was mended by 1998, where a majority of Hufflepuffs rose to defend Harry from Pansy Parkinson and later helped to defend Hogwarts.<br><br>
