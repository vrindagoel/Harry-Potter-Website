		Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is a 2009 film based on the sixth novel by J. K. Rowling. It is the sixth film in the Harry Potter film series. David Yates, the director of the fifth film, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, directed this film. David Heyman and David Barron produced,[3] and Steve Kloves, though he did not write the fifth film, has returned as screenwriter for this instalment.[4] Filming began on September 24, 2007. The film was released in the UK, Canada and US on July 15, 2009 in regular theatres, and an IMAX 3-D release on July 29, 2009.[5][4][6] Unlike the previous film, the sixth film was released in regular theatres on July 15 and IMAX 3-D on July 29 because of the IMAX release of Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen.[7] The film was chosen to be screened at the Royal Film Performance on November 17, 2008, but due to the date of release being pushed back, it was not shown. On January 2, 2009, the film received a PG rating in the USA. On July 7, 2009, at the world film premiere of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince in London, the cast and crew all wore white ribbons in memory and tribute of 18-year-old British actor and co-star Robert Knox. Knox, who played Marcus Belby in the film, was stabbed to death on May 24, 2008.<br><br><br>

<hr align="left" noshade color=DarkTurquoise width="100%" height=1px>
Voldemort is tightening his grip on both the Muggle and Wizarding worlds and Hogwarts is no longer the safe haven it once was. Harry suspects that dangers may even lie within the castle, but Dumbledore is more intent upon preparing him for the final battle that he knows is fast approaching. Together they work to find the key to unlock Voldemort's defences and, to this end, Dumbledore recruits his old friend and colleague, the well-connected and unsuspecting bon vivant Professor Horace Slughorn, whom he believes holds crucial information. Meanwhile, the students are under attack from a very different adversary as teenage hormones rage across the ramparts. Harry finds himself more and more drawn to Ginny Weasley, but so is Dean Thomas. And Lavender Brown has decided that Ron is the one for her, only she hadn't counted on Romilda Vane's chocolates. And then there's Hermione, simmering with jealously but determined not to show her feelings. As romance blossoms, one student remains aloof. He is determined to make his mark, albeit a dark one. Love is in the air, but tragedy lies ahead and Hogwarts may never be the same again.<br><br><br>
