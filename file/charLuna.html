Perhaps it was the fact that she had stuck her wand behind her left ear for safekeeping, or that she had chosen to wear a necklace of Butterbeer caps, or that she was reading a magazine upside down." <br>&mdash;—Luna's unusual disposition</p><br><br><br>
			Luna Lovegood (b. 13 February, 1981[1]) was a witch, the only child and daughter of Xenophilius and Pandora Lovegood. Her mother accidentally died while experimenting with spells when Luna was nine and Luna was raised by her father, editor of the magazine The Quibbler, in a rook-like house near the village of Ottery St Catchpole in Devon. <br><br><br>
			Luna attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry from 1992-1999 and was sorted into Ravenclaw House. In her fourth year, Luna joined Dumbledore's Army, an organisation taught and led by Harry Potter, of which she became an important member. She participated in the Battle of the Department of Mysteries (1996) and the Battle of the Astronomy Tower (1997), and co-led the reconstituted Dumbledore's Army when Hogwarts fell under the control of Lord Voldemort. <br><br><br>
			Because of her father's political dissidence at the time, Luna was abducted by Death Eaters to be held ransom, and imprisoned in the dungeons of Malfoy Manor for months. She was freed by Dobby along with several other prisoners in the spring of 1998, and stayed at Shell Cottage until she returned to Hogwarts to participate in the final battle of the Second Wizarding War.<br><br><br> 
			After the war, Luna became a Magizoologist (magical naturalist) discovering and classifying many species that had never been encountered before. She eventually married Rolf Scamander, with whom she had twin sons, Lorcan and Lysander. Luna's good friends Harry and Ginny Potter also named their daughter and third child, Lily Luna Potter, in honour of her. <br><br><br>

<p style="margin-left: 50px; margin-right:50px; color:grey">"Luna was once again demonstrating her usual knack of speaking of uncomfortable truths; he has never meet anyone quite like her." <br>&mdash;—Luna's unusual character traits[src]</p> <br><br><br>
Luna was an extremely quirky girl with a serene disposition and many eccentric beliefs and qualities. She was a complete nonconformist; she lacked self-consciousness and was not afraid to show who she truly was. Luna was also intelligent and unusually perceptive, having been sorted into Ravenclaw,[12] "where those of wit and learning will always find their kind." Although many thought Luna was bizarre, Harry, Hermione, Ron, Neville, Ginny, Dean Thomas, and Ollivander eventually became very fond of her.[13] <br><br><br>
Her demeanour and voice were often distant and dreamy, and she would drift away from a conversation she did not find interesting; however, whenever someone made fun of her father or The Quibbler, of which he was editor, the airy, dreamy quality in her voice would vanish and be replaced by one of steel (almost as sharp as a double-edged sword), and she would immediately become very angry. She had an uncanny way of making others uncomfortable by being bluntly honest — a "knack for embarrassing honesty" according to Harry. She was completely unflappable and rarely seemed anxious or under stress, even under difficult circumstances such as being a prisoner of Malfoy Manor. Luna was very good at comforting others, such as when she comforted Harry Potter after his godfather's death,[12] and Mr Ollivander while they were imprisoned together.[14] <br><br><br><br><br><br>
Luna was often the subject of ridicule and had difficulty making friends. Other students gave her the nickname of "Loony Lovegood" and even stole and hid her things. She was unfazed by this, though, and instead chose to be nonjudgmental and accepting of the others around her.[12] She once said that she does not like dancing much, though she did dance some at the wedding of Bill and Fleur, along with her father. Luna seems to have enjoyed artistic pursuits in her free time; her house was filled with various things that she painted.[14] Luna was very loyal to the few friends she had, supporting Harry even when he was outlawed by the Ministry of Magic; Ron stated that she certainly has far more courage than her father, who was at the time stressed under duress. She also displayed admirable bravery during both the Battle of the Department of Mysteries and the Battle of Hogwarts. <br><br><br>
<br><br><br>

<h2><font face=serif>Magical Abilities And Skills</font></h2>
<hr align="left" noshade color=DarkTurquoise width="100%" height=1px>
<br><br>
Luna was shown to be a skilful and talented witch. At the age of fourteen she was able to conjure a corporeal Patronus — a very advanced piece of magic and proof that she possessed superior magical ability.<br><br><br>
<ol>
<li><b>Duelling:</b> Despite her young age, Luna was a competent duellist. At the age of fifteen, she participated in and survived the Battle of the Department of Mysteries with no more than a few minor injuries. She also emerged from the Battle of the Astronomy Tower with no major injuries. During the Battle of Hogwarts, she duelled against Lord Voldemort's most powerful servant, Bellatrix Lestrange, whom she fought alongside Hermione and Ginny, and emerged as one of the survivors. <br><br><br>
<li><b>Charms: </b>In her fourth year, Luna learned how to conjure a corporeal Patronus, which was a very advanced piece of magic. It took the form of a hare.<br><br><br> 
<li><b>Non-verbal magic:</b> Shortly before the Battle of Hogwarts in 1998, Luna accompanied Harry to Ravenclaw Tower, where she wordlessly stunned the Death Eater, Alecto Carrow. Though she admitted that it was the first time she had ever used that spell outside of practise, the fact that she could effectively cast it non-verbally is a testament of sorts to her being a powerful witch, since non-verbal magic is very difficult. <br><br><br>
<li><b>Care of Magical Creatures:</b> After her graduation from Hogwarts, Luna became a Magizoologist, a wizarding naturalist. Before that, she suggested that she, Harry, Ron, Ginny and Neville went to the Ministry of Magic using Thestrals, demonstrating her aptitude for magical creatures earlier on, despite her earlier disapproval of Rubeus Hagrid's teaching. <br><br><br>
<li><b>Creativity:</b> Luna invented a lion-shaped hat that, with a tap of a wand, made a realistic roar. She also made a flapping eagle hat. <br><br><br>
<li><b>Leadership skills:</b> At the age of sixteen, Luna co-led Dumbledore's Army along with her friends, Ginny and Neville. Their leadership was so efficient that she was abducted in an attempt to force the resistance to surrender, though she was ultimately rescued by Harry and Ron. <br><br><br>

<h2><font face=serif>Possesions</font></h2>
<hr align="left" noshade color=DarkTurquoise width="100%" height=1px>
<br><br>
<ol>
<li><b>Wand:</b> Luna Lovegood's first wand was of unknown length, wood, and core material. This wand she used through out her Hogwarts career, until she was captured and her wand confiscated by Death Eaters in the middle of her sixth year. Her second wand is of unknown length, wood, and core material as well. It was made by Garrick Ollivander in the spring of 1998 after his rescue from Malfoy Manor. <br><br><br>
<li><b>Lion hat:</b> Luna created this hat that had the appearance of an ordinary pointed hat topped with a fake stuffed lion. When she tapped the hat with her wand, it let out an extremely realistic roar. She wore it to show her support of Gryffindor whenever they played against the Slytherin Quidditch team. <br><br><br>
<li><b>Eagle hat:</b> Luna wore this hat whenever the Ravenclaw Quidditch team played against the Gryffindor Quidditch team. On top of the hat is what appears to be a living eagle, which flapped its wings. <br><br><br>
<li><b>Dress robes:</b> Luna wore silver dress robes to the Slug Club Christmas Party in 1996 when she was taken as a guest by Harry Potter. Luna also owned a pair of yellow dress robes that she wore to the wedding of Bill and Fleur in 1997.<br><br><br>
<li><b>Beetle wing earrings: </b>This was one of the the items on her lost possessions list. She, at first, had believed they were stolen and taken away by Nargles, but then later realised it was just her classmates. <br><br><br>
<li><b>Silver star earrings: </b>Luna wore these to the Slug Club Christmas Party in 1996, along with her silver dress robes. <br><br><br>
<li><b>Dirigible plum-shaped earrings:</b> Luna wore these earrings when she expressed her belief in Harry, during 1995. In 1998 Harry noticed a bush covered in exceptionally strange and orange, radish-like fruit called Dirigible plum and notes their striking resemblance to Luna's earrings. <br><br><br>
<li><b>Hare bracelet:</b> This bracelet was owned by Luna. It was made of a golden material and adorned with a small hare penchant, similar to her Patronus. <br><br><br>
<li><b>Patterned shoes:</b> Luna has a pair of patterned converse, with what looks likes strawberries on them. They are stolen by some other pupils and hidden, with the rest of her shoes. Luna has to walk around bare foot for most of the Order of the Phoenix because of this. <br><br><br>
<li><b>Purple Quill:</b> Luna owned this quill during the 1995-1996 school year before it was stolen by her classmates. It was produced from a feather of a woodpecker. <br><br><br>
<li><b>Butterbeer cork necklace:</b> She often wore it during her school days, to keep away Nargles. Many of the students found this odd. <br><br><br>
<li><b>Beetle ring:</b> Luna wore this ring in 1995 and possibly earlier. <br><br><br>
<li><b>Bubble Bow Booster:</b> Luna owned a kit that was still in its original packaging, but someone took it from her and hid it during the 1995-1996 school year. <br><br><br>
<li><b>Sum-solving ink:</b> This was a type of ink that presumably helped solve math problems. Luna owned a bottle of turquoise sum-solving ink, but someone took it from her and hid it during her fourth year. <br><br><br>
<li><b>Dumbledore's Army coin:</b> Luna owned one of these coins as a member of Dumbledore's Army. <br><br><br>
<li><b>Easy Spells to Fool Muggles:</b> Luna owned a copy of this book by Luca Caruso but, it was stolen from her sometime during the 1995-1996 school year. <br><br><br>
<li><b>Spectrespecs:</b> Luna owned and wore a pair of Spectrespecs on the train ride to Hogwarts in 1996. The spectrespecs were large and colourful and were given away free in an issue of The Quibbler in 1996. <br><br><br>
