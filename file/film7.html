		Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 is the first instalment of a two-part film based on Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows by J. K. Rowling.<br><Br>
		David Yates, who directed the preceding two films, directed both parts, with Steve Kloves returning to script.[2] The first part was released on November 19, 2010, with the second following in July 2011.[3] Production of the two films occurred concurrently,[4] and treated as if it were one film.[5] The idea to split the films had been around since the middle of 2007,[2] but only really came into serious consideration after producer David Heyman was able to talk to writer Steve Kloves when the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike ended and Heyman had Rowling's approval.<br><br>
		On March 12, 2008, Warner Bros. additionally confirmed that the film would be split into two, to do justice to the book.[6] David Yates, director of Order of the Phoenix and Half-Blood Prince returned to direct and Steve Kloves wrote the screenplay. According to Warner Bros. executive Alan F. Horn it allowed "an extra hour and a half to celebrate what this franchise has been and do justice to all the words and ideas in the amazing story."[4] Heyman described the workings behind the split: "Deathly Hallows is so rich, the story so dense and there is so much that is resolved that, after discussing it with Rowling, we came to the conclusion that two parts were needed."[4] Due to the WGA strike, Kloves was not able to start work on the script until it ended.<br><br>
		Before David Yates was officially chosen to direct the film, others had expressed an interest in the job. Alfonso Cuarón, director of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, had said that he would be "tempted" to return to direct.[8] Guillermo del Toro, who passed on Prisoner of Azkaban, had expressed interest in directing Deathly Hallows,[9] but an increased workload ruled him out of the project.<br><br>
		Heyman noted that the films would be a closer recreation of the books than the previous films because of the length a two-part adaptation entails.[11] Daniel Radcliffe said: "This is a road movie, particularly in Part One of the film. People have been so used to seeing Harry Potter at Hogwarts and we're just not there for the first part of the film. That seems to have really freshened things up, and hopefully will get people seeing the films with fresh eyes again, because it's just a totally different look when you're not just sat [sitting] in the same room the whole time."<br><br><br>

<h2><font face=serif >Plot</font></h2>
<hr align="left" noshade color=DarkTurquoise width="100%" height=1px>
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, the seventh and final adventure in the Harry Potter film series, is a motion picture event, told in two full-length parts.<br><bR>
Part 1 begins as Harry, Ron and Hermione set out on their perilous mission to track down and destroy the Horcruxes—the keys to Voldemort's immortality. On their own, without the guidance or protection of their professors, the three friends must now rely on one another more than ever. But there are Dark Forces in their midst that threaten to tear them apart.<br><br><br>
Meanwhile, the Wizarding world has become a dangerous place for all enemies of the Dark Lord. The long-feared war has begun and Voldemort's Death Eaters seize control of the Ministry of Magic and even Hogwarts, terrorising and arresting anyone who might oppose them. But the one prize they still seek is the one most valuable to Voldemort: Harry Potter. The Chosen One has become the hunted one as Voldemort's followers look for Harry with orders to bring him to the Dark Lord…alive.<br><br><br>
Harry's only hope is to find the Horcruxes before Voldemort finds him. But as he searches for clues, he uncovers an old and almost forgotten tale—the legend of the Deathly Hallows. And if the legend turns out to be true, it could give Voldemort the ultimate power he seeks. Little does Harry know that his future has already been decided by his past when, on that fateful day, he became “the Boy Who Lived.” No longer just a boy, Harry Potter is drawing ever closer to the task for which he has been preparing since the day he first stepped into Hogwarts: the ultimate battle with Voldemort.<br><br><br>
