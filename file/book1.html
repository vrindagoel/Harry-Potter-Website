			Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone is the first novel in the Harry Potter series. The book was first published on 26 June, 1997[1] by Bloomsbury in London, and was later made into a film of the same name.<br><br><br>
			Both the book and motion picture were released in the United States under the name Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, because the publishers were concerned that most American readers would not be familiar enough with the term "Philosopher's Stone". However this discussion lead to criticism by the British public who felt as if it shouldn't be changed due to the fact it was an English book.<br><br><br>

"Harry Potter has never played a sport while flying on a broomstick. He's never worn a Cloak of Invisibility, befriended a giant, or helped hatch a dragon. All Harry knows is a miserable life with the Dursleys, his horrible aunt and uncle, and their abominable son, Dudley. Harry's room is a tiny Cupboard Under the Stairs, and he hasn't had a birthday party in ten years.<br><br><br>
But all that is about to change when a mysterious letter arrives by owl messenger. A letter with an invitation to a wonderful place he never dreamed existed. There he finds not only friends, aerial sports, and magic around every corner, but a great destiny that's been waiting for him... if Harry can survive the encounter."<br><br><br>

A letter with an invitation to an incredible place called Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. There he finds not only friends, flying sports on broomsticks, and magic in everything from classes to meals, but a great destiny that's been waiting for him... if Harry can survive the encounter."<br><BR><BR>

On his 11th birthday a giant man named Rubeus Hagrid hands him a letter telling him that he has been accepted as a student at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Harry learns that his parents were wizards and were killed by an evil wizard Voldemort, a truth that was hidden from him all these years. He embarks for his new life as a student, gathering two good friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger along the way. They soon learn that something very valuable is hidden somewhere inside the school and Voldemort is very anxious to lay his hands on it.<br><br><br>
