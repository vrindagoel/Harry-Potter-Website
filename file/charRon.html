			<p style="margin-left: 50px; margin-right:50px; color:grey">"I'm the sixth in our family to go to Hogwarts. You could say I got a lot to live up to. Bill and Charlie have already left — Bill was Head Boy and Charlie was captain of Quidditch. Now Percy's a prefect. Fred and George mess around a lot, but they still get really good marks and everyone thinks they're really funny. Everyone expects me to do as well as the others, but if I do, it's no big deal, because they did it first."<br>&mdash; Ron regarding his family and their expectations[</p>
			Ronald Bilius[24] "Ron" Weasley (b. 1 March, 1980) was a pure-blood[2] wizard, the sixth and youngest son of Arthur and Molly Weasley (née Prewett). He was also the younger brother of Bill, Charlie, Percy, Fred, George, and the elder brother of Ginny. Ron and his brothers and sister lived at the Burrow, on the outskirts of Ottery St Catchpole.<br><br><br>
			Ron began attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in 1991 and was Sorted into Gryffindor House. He soon became best friends with fellow student Harry Potter and later Hermione Granger. Together, they faced many challenges during their adolescence, including keeping the Philosopher's Stone from Professor Quirinus Quirrell, saving Ginny from the Basilisk of the Chamber of Secrets, saving Harry's godfather Sirius Black from the Dementors of Azkaban, guiding Harry through the Triwizard Tournament, forming Dumbledore's Army and fighting in numerous battles of the Second Wizarding War: including the Battle of the Department of Mysteries (1996), Battle of the Astronomy Tower (1997), and Battle of the Seven Potters (1997). Ron also became a Gryffindor prefect and a Keeper on the Gryffindor Quidditch team during his fifth year at Hogwarts. He skipped his last year of school in order to accompany Harry and Hermione on a hunt to destroy all of Lord Voldemort's Horcruxes and fought in the Battle of Hogwarts in 1998, during which he lost his brother Fred, a loss which devastated him and his family, especially George, his twin.<br><bR><bR>
			After the war, Ron became an Auror and helped reform and revolutionise the Ministry of Magic.[25] After two years as an Auror, he went to work at Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes with his brother George.[26] He and Hermione eventually married and had two children, Rose and Hugo Granger-Weasley. Ron was also named the godfather of James Sirius Potter, his sister Ginny Weasley's and Harry Potter's eldest child.<br><br><bR>

<h2><font face=serif >Physical Appearance</font></h2>
<hr align="left" noshade color=DarkTurquoise width="100%" height=1px>
<br><br>
Ron inherited the typical Weasley family traits: fiery red hair and a freckled complexion. When he became embarrassed, his ears notably turned red. He had blue eyes, a long nose, and was described as being very tall and lanky, with big hands and feet.[27] In this way, his stature was similar to those of his older brothers Bill and Percy, rather than the heavily built Charlie, and Fred and George.<br><bR>
His sister Ginny once joked to the trio that Ron had a Pygmy Puff tattoo, though it is doubtful that the remark had any truth in it. By 2014, when he was at the age of 34, Rita Skeeter remarked on a Daily Prophet gossip column that his "famous ginger hair appears to be thinning slightly". By 2017, Ron had settled into a rotund middle age[41] and was later described to be getting "a bit of a gut" by his nephew, yet hiding it extremely well.<br><br><bR>

<h2><font face=serif >Posessions</font></h2>
<hr align="left" noshade color=DarkTurquoise width="100%" height=1px>
<p style="margin-left: 50px; margin-right:50px; color:grey"><br>"You never get anything new, either, with five brothers. I've got Bill's old robes, Charlie's old wand and Percy's old rat."<br>&mdash; Ron talking about being the youngest son in the family to Harry</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Wand: </b>Ron initially used his brother Charlie's old, chipped wand, made of ash with a unicorn hair sticking out of the end. He held the wand together with Spellotape after nearly breaking it in half at the start of his second year, but it malfunctioned dreadfully after this, backfiring spells, making strange noises, and emitting objects out from the wrong end. It eventually exploded.[29] Before his third year, he received a new wand, fourteen inches, willow and unicorn hair. This wand seemed to suit him better, but he lost it at Malfoy Manor in 1998 and it is questionable whether he ever retrieved it.<br><br><br>
<li><b>Spellotape: </b>He uses the Spellotape to hold together his first wand after nearly breaking it in half at the start of his second year, but it malfunctions dreadfully after this, backfiring spells, making strange noises and emitting objects from the wrong end. (He borrowed this from Seamus Finnigan.)<br><br><br>
<li><b>Pigwidgeon: </b>Ron's first pet owl he was gifted to him from Sirius Black in 1994. Pigwidgeon was described by Harry as resembling a "fluffy snitch". Though Ron acted very rude to Pigwidgeon in public, he was actually very attached to Pig, since this was his first owl.<br><br><br>
<li><b>Dress Robes: </b>Ron wore a set of dress robes to the Yule Ball in 1994. They were very traditional in style, and thus old-fashioned and frilly, much to Ron's distaste. Ron also owns a second set of dress robes, a present from the twins in the summer break of 1995. These robes were bought with some of Harry's Triwizard winnings, as a stipulation of him giving the money to Fred and George. These robes were only mentioned, never described.<br><br><br>
<li><b>Delmuinator: </b>Ron inherited the deluminator from Dumbledore.<br><br><br>
<li><b>Watch: </b>He received a golden wristwatch on his 17th birthday from his parents.<br><br><br>
<li><b>Cleansweep Eleven: </b>In the summer of 1995, Ronald Weasley was given a Cleansweep Eleven as a present from his parents for becoming a Prefect, and used it when he played as Keeper for the Gryffindor Quidditch team.<br><br><br>
<li><b>Shooting Star: </b>Ron had a Shooting Star when he was young.<br><br><br>
<li><b>Sweetheart Necklace: </b>Ron received the necklace from Lavender Brown as a Christmas present in 1996, though it is unlikely that he kept it following their break up.<br><br><br>
<li><b>Chocolate Frog Cards: </b>Ron had about five hundred chocolate frog cards.<br><br><br>
<li><b>Wizard's Chess Set: </b> Ron had a battered old Wizard's Chess set in 1991. Like most other things he had, it was secondhand, being passed down to him by his grandfather. However, his chessmen were therefore more likely to trust his judgement in battle.<br><br><br>
