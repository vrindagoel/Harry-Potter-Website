<p style="margin-left: 50px; margin-right:50px; color:grey">"The Elder Wand," he said, and he drew a straight vertical line on the parchment. "The Resurrection Stone," he said, and he added a circle on top of the line. "The Cloak of Invisibility," he finished, enclosing both line and circle in a triangle, to make the symbol that so intrigued Hermione. "Together," he said, "the Deathly Hallows."<br>â€”Xenophilius Lovegood</p>
<p align=justify>The Deathly Hallows are three highly powerful magical objects supposedly created by Death and given to each of three brothers in the Peverell family. They consisted of the Elder Wand, an immensely powerful wand that was considered unbeatable; the Resurrection Stone, a stone which could summon the spirits of the dead, and the Cloak of Invisibility, which, as its name suggests, renders the user completely invisible. According to the story, both Antioch Peverell (owner of the Wand) and Cadmus Peverell (owner of the Stone) came to bad ends. However, Ignotus Peverell's wisdom in requesting the Cloak was rewarded.<br><br>
According to legend, he who possesses these three artefacts would become the Master of Death. Dumbledore told Harry that he and another wizard, Gellert Grindelwald took this to mean that the uniter of the Deathly Hallows would be invincible. The story of the Deathly Hallows was originally told by Beedle the Bard and subsequently passed from family to family as a wizard fairytale. Few wizards ever realised that the Deathly Hallows were genuine items. Most people thought that there were things that Beedle had made up to entertain young wizards and witches.<br><br>
No one but Harry Potter has been known to have been in command of all three at the same time, though he was never in possession of them all at once (he dropped the stone in the Forbidden Forest just before gaining the wand that he had won the alliance of in a previous scuffle at Malfoy Manor). Albus Dumbledore had possessed all three, but not all at once, similar to Harry, but he was never the true owner of the Cloak.<br><br>

<h2><font face=serif >The Elder Wand</font></h2>
<hr align="left" noshade color=DarkTurquoise width="100%" height=1px>
<img src="Hallows2.jpg" align=right height=200px style="padding:20px">
<p align=justify>As Harry Potter had no intention of using the Elder Wand for his own purposes (having achieved his goal of defeating Voldemort), he only used it to restore his own broken wand. He then at an unknown date returned the Elder Wand to the grave of Albus Dumbledore, located on the grounds of Hogwarts, supposing that, if he died of natural causes, its power would finally be broken, and its history of blood and violence along with it.<br><br>
The wand has a different fate in the films, where Harry snaps the wand in half and throws it off the gorge saying that he doesn't want it.<br><br>

<hr align="left" noshade color=DarkTurquoise width="100%" height=1px>
<img src="Hallows3.jpg" align=right height=200px style="padding:20px">
<p align=justify>After Harry turned the stone over in his hand thrice, and was immediately joined by the shades of his parents, Sirius Black, and Remus Lupin, he discarded the Resurrection Stone. It was lost somewhere in the Forbidden Forest near Aragog's lair, where Harry intended it to remain. J. K. Rowling later revealed that a centaur pressed it into the ground by stomping on it as the herd charged to help the defenders of Hogwarts in the fight against Voldemort and his Death Eaters.<br><br>

<hr align="left" noshade color=DarkTurquoise width="100%" height=1px>
<img src="Hallows4.jpg" align=right height=200px style="padding:20px">
<p align=justify>As for the Cloak of Invisibility, Harry remarked to Dumbledore's portrait that he would be keeping it for himself and his family [HP7]; it is most likely still with him to this day and probably passed it down to one of his children. As of The Cursed Child, James Sirius Potter owns the Invisibility Cloak.<br><br>
