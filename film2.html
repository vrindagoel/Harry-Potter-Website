<br><br>
<ol>
<li>When Dobby first sees Harry, there is a red flag and an orange flag behind him (Dobby). You can see that the orange flag is missing a thumb tack. When Harry tells Dobby that he's not supposed to be there, the thumb tack is there.<br><br><br>
<li>In Borgin & Burkes, the Hand of Glory is wrapped around Harry's hand. In the next shot, it is wrapped around his wrist.<br><br><br>
<li>In Borgin & Burkes, while Harry is looking at the jar of skulls, there is nothing next to the jar, In the next shot, an iron stand appears out of nowhere.<br><br><br>
<li>When Lockhart is saying "it's 27th week atop the Daily Prophet Bestseller List..." the camera scrolls up to Malfoy. You can clearly see Tom Felton's tape mark marking where he is supposed to place his feet.<br><br><br>
<li>While Harry and Ron are crashing into Platform 9 3/4, Hedwig is obviously just a stuffed owl.<br><br><br>
<li>Right after Harry and Ron crash into the platform, Ron's suitcase has three brown lines. Five shots later, it has two lines<br><br><br>
<li>After they get beaten up by the Whomping Willow, you can see a hole in Ron's suitcase and it is a perfect circular.<br><br><br>
<li>The pixies are green-screen so they had to use binder clips to stretch out Neville's ears to make the scene where the pixies drag Neville up and hang him on the chandelier. After the pixies let go, Neville's ears stay stretched.<br><br><br>
<li>In the scene where Harry and Ron are about to be attacked by Aragog's family in the dark forest, the (formerly) flying car comes to save them. Harry, Ron, and Fang scramble to get in the car, and Fang gets in first, on the driver's side. A spider runs up to attack Harry, but Harry repels it with a spell. As it is running up to Harry, Fang can be seen entering the car a second time.<br><br><br>
<li>During one of the last scenes of the movie when Harry, Dumbledore and Lucius Malfoy are in Dumbledore's office, the original hair of Jason Issacs, who plays Lucius Malfoy, is visible at the back behind his wig.<br><br><br>
<li>In the Duelling Club scene, after Harry hits Draco with "Rictusempra" and Draco hits the ground, when Snape pulls him up a crew member holding a camera is fully visible in the left corner. Also, a tape marker can be seen under Snape's feet.<br><br><br>
<li>When Harry gets bitten by the basilisk, his arm is seen next to the snake tooth. This is to avoid injury. His arm is seen at least 3 inches away from the tooth.<br><br><br>
